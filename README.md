# cppRunner
auto delete exe and you can run cpp from `cpp main.cpp` command like `python main.py `

### how to use
1) first install mingw and add mingw/bin to path (environment variables)
2) then clone this repo at any location and add dist to environment variables !!![make sure you move dist folder up from mingw/bin folder in path variable because there is already a cpp.exe in mingw/bin] (or first add cppRunner/dist then add mingw/bin to environment variables)
3) or you can just download cpp.exe and past it in mingw/bin folder and add mingw to environment variables but there anready have cpp.exe so do 1st method or replace cpp.exe

5) `cpp main.cpp` runs fine like `python main.py`

### why use this
just use it because in vs code i don't like extra exe in my workspace
